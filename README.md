# genetic_algorithm_for_intrusion_detection
Selection of dynamic features based on genetic algorithm of non-dominant sorting and combination with Fuzzy clustering for intrusion detection system
------------------------------------------
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a crucial component in modern network security infrastructure, designed to detect and prevent unauthorized access, intrusions, and malicious activities within a network or system.

IDS comprises hardware devices and software applications that continuously monitor network activities and analyze the data for potential threats.An intrusion is generally considered as any unauthorized activity that takes place in a network or system.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a widely used optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution.
Clustering is an important mechanism in data analysis to define or organize a group of patterns or objects into clusters.The ultimate goal of data clustering is to achieve unsupervised classification of complex data.

Attacks fall into four main categories:dos-probing-R2L (Remote To Local)-U2R (User To Root)

To check the results and efficiency of the proposed system, we used 80% of the NSL-KDD dataset as training and 20% as testing.

The results have been calculated separately based on the three main parameters of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with previously proposed algorithms.
