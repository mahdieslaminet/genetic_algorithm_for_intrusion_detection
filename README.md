## Overview
The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a crucial role in modern network security infrastructure by detecting and preventing unauthorized access, intrusions, and malicious activities within a network or system. This project focuses on enhancing IDS efficiency through the selection of dynamic features using a genetic algorithm based on non-dominant sorting and combining it with Fuzzy clustering.

### Key Components
- Genetic Algorithm for feature selection
- Non-dominant sorting optimization technique
- Fuzzy clustering for data organization

## Dataset and Evaluation
To assess the effectiveness of our proposed system, we utilized 80% of the NSL-KDD dataset for training and 20% for testing. The evaluation was based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics compared to previous algorithms.
